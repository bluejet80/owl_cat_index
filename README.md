# owl_cat_index
Creating the indexing functionality of the journal site
## explanation
The main Javascript file is owl_index.js

the main object is owl_index. It contains the first lines of the journal pages.   
It also contains now the category designation of each page.   
The categories object contains the various categories as well as the methods that create the print, and search functionality. 

Sometimes I name variables that dont matter random names. 

function/method calls are at the very bottom of the file.
